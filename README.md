# Game Sprite Background Remover
Speeds up sprite extraction by removing the surrounding colors from the area you choose.  
Saves all the sprites you extract to a single sprite sheet with a 1px clear border to prevent image bleeding.

### Operation
1. Run: `./start <spritesheet.png>`
2. Set your Primary and Secondary colors.
3. Outline the sprite you want.
4. Extract and see the result in the preview pane.
5. Save all of them to a single spritesheet.

### Notes
* Extract one sprite image at a time.
* After extracting all the images you want (up to 12?) then save all to a sprite sheet
* Program assumes there is a primary and secondary color.
    * (give example screen shots here)
* Will preview sprites up to 200 x 200 pixels
